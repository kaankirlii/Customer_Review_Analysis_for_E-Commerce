# Customer Review Analysis for E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews for an e-commerce platform using Google Colaboratory. The dataset contains key parameters such as customer name, surname, product name, rating (ranging from 1 to 5), and their comments. By leveraging Python and its libraries, particularly Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we aim to gain insights into customer sentiment, product performance, and areas for improvement.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following parameters:
- **Name**: First name of the customer.
- **Surname**: Last name of the customer.
- **Product name**: Name of the product being reviewed.
- **Rating**: A numerical rating ranging from 1 to 5, reflecting the customer's satisfaction level.
- **Comment**: Free-form text where customers provide detailed feedback on their experience with the product.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and data normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the distribution of ratings, identifying trends, and exploring relationships between variables.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of customer comments.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features such as comment length to enhance analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generating visualizations to present insights effectively, including histograms, bar plots, and word clouds.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Exploring correlations between variables and conducting deeper analysis.
- **Reporting**: Summarizing key findings and insights for stakeholders.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Google Colaboratory**: Leveraging the power of cloud-based Jupyter notebooks for collaborative data analysis.
- **Python Libraries**: Utilizing Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, and WordCloud for data manipulation, visualization, sentiment analysis, and text processing.
